    description:
      "An EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a server hosted on AWS(Amazon Web Services). In simpler terms, these are virtual machines which are running on a cloud. EC2 instances allow you to choose from CPU, memory, storage and networking configurations based on your requirements. They are scalable, reliable and accessible globally, which means if you needed to host your own cloud based applications, you will be able to access it from any region(unless you specify).",

    title: "A Guide to Design a responsive website",
    description:
      "During the early days of the Internet, websites were accessible only through big computers. But now we can access a website through our Phones, PCs and Laptops. Meaning a website should be accessible to the user from any of the devices, no matter what the screen size, processing power, etc. Thus, creating a need for a responsive design for websites. We donâ€™t want our website to look great in some specific screen ratio or size but not with others. This limits the number of users we may have received if our website was responsive.",
